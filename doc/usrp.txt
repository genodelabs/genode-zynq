Abstract
########

The USRP e310 is a "Universal Software Radio Peripheral" by Ettus Research.
It bases on a Zynq-7000 SoC and a AD9361 RF transceiver from Analog Devices.

Since the transceiver is partly driven by the FPGA, the software support heavily
depends on the bitstream used for the FPGA. Note, that we use a customised
FPGA design based on the reference design by Analog Devices for th AD9361.
Note, that the reference design by Ettus Research contains entirely different
IP cores and is therefore not supported.

Quick start to deploy Genode on the USRP e310
#############################################

Before getting started with the USRP, please make sure that you have
familiarised yourself with Genode.
A good entry point is the
[https://genode.org/documentation/developer-resources/getting_started - Getting Started guide],
which transfers the bare minimum but mandatory knowledge.

If you already have an SD card with a preinstalled application for the USRP,
you can attach a micro-USB cable to the USRP and connect it to your Linux host
in order to test your hardware setup.
A '/dev/ttyUSB0' device should pop up even if the USRP is not powered on.
Start a terminal program of your liking (e.g. picocom, screen) and push power on
button to see the board's serial output.

! sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB1 115200

Note, if you are already working on Sculpt (i.e. in a Linux VM hosted on Sculpt),
you must first
[http://genodians.org/m-stein/2021-04-29-sculpt-21-03-usb-passthough - pass through the USB device]
to your VM.


Creating a build directory
==========================

If you not already followed the README instructions of this repository, use the
following command to create a build directory for the Zynq.

! ./tool/create_builddir arm_v7a

Don't forget to edit the 'build/arm_v7a/etc/build.conf' to add this repository:

! REPOSITORIES += $(GENODE_DIR)/repos/zynq

Optionally, the following definitions set the USRP as the default target BOARD and
base-hw as the default kernel.

! BOARD ?= zynq_usrp_e31x
! KERNEL ?= hw


Preparing the SD card
=====================

For initialising a blank SD card with a bootable scenario, you can build a
complete SD card image as follows.
First, make sure, that you have an 'mkimage' binary available, which is provided
by 'u-boot-tools' on Ubuntu. You also need 'mtools', which provides the 'mcopy'
binary. You must also prepare the zynq_uboot port by executing the following
command from genode directory:

! ./tool/ports/prepare_port zynq_uboot

Second, add the following to your 'build/arm_v7a/etc/build.conf':

! RUN_OPT_usrp  = --include image/uboot
! RUN_OPT_usrp += --include image/zynq_uboot_sdcard
! RUN_OPT_usrp += --image_uboot_bitstream /path/to/your/bitstream
! BOARD_RUN_OPT(zynq_usrp_e31x) = $(RUN_OPT_usrp)

The second line is optional and has the effect that the given bitstream file
will be included in the image and automatically loaded by u-boot.

Next, run the following commands to build the image file and to write it to
an SD card.

! build/arm_v7a$ make run/log KERNEL=hw BOARD=zynq_usrp_e31x
! ...
! Created SD-card image file var/run/log.img
! build/arm_v7a$ sudo dd if=var/run/log.img of=/dev/mmcblkX bs=1M conv=fsync

_Do not forget to adjust /dev/mmcblkX to the device of your SD card._

Usually, this step is only required once or for deploying a certain scenario on
the SD card. For maximum enjoyment of development, we prefer booting via TFTP and
thereby omit fiddling with SD card.


Enabling run-tool plugins for tftpboot
======================================

Edit 'build/arm_v7a/etc/build.conf' to create a bootable u-boot image and to use
tftp boot and a serial connection.

! RUN_OPT_usrp  = --include image/uboot
! RUN_OPT_usrp += --include load/tftp
! RUN_OPT_usrp += --load-tftp-base-dir /srv/tftp/usrp
! RUN_OPT_usrp += --load-tftp-offset-dir /uImage
! RUN_OPT_usrp += --load-tftp-absolute
! RUN_OPT_usrp += --include log/serial
! RUN_OPT_usrp += --log-serial-cmd "picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0"
! BOARD_RUN_OPT(zynq_usrp_e31x) = $(RUN_OPT_usrp)

Don't forget to install a TFTP server on your development system and to check
that the base directory given by '--load-tftp-base-dir' is served by your TFTP
server. If you are working from Sculpt, you must also add a forwarding rule to
your NIC router config:

! <domain name="uplink">
!   [...]
!   <udp-forward port="69" domain="default" to="10.0.1.2" />
! </domain>

Here, '10.0.1.2' must match with the IP address of your VM.


Enabling tftpboot on the USRP e310
==================================

As a prerequisite, make sure that the Zybo Z7 board is connected to the Ethernet
as your development system with the tftp server running.
You can check output from u-boot to see whether the network connection was
established and ensure that the board got an IP address via DHCP.

In order to configure the board's u-boot for tftpboot, we can create a
uEnv.txt file on the SD card.
Our u-boot loads the uEnv.txt if present and executes 'uenvcmd'.

! serverip=x.x.x.x
! kernel_img=/srv/tftp/usrp/uImage
! uenvcmd=tftpboot ${load_addr} ${serverip}:${kernel_img} && bootm start && bootm loados && bootm go

You may also set a MAC address by defining 'ethaddr=...' in your uEnv.txt.
Otherwise, u-boot will generate a random MAC address.

Note, that you must insert the IP address of your development system for 'serverip'.
The tftpboot command pulls the 'kernel_img' from 'server_ip' and loads it into
memory at 'load_addr'. Double check, that the 'kernel_img' corresponds to the path
under which the image is provided by your tftp server.

_Since we do not provide a dtb,_
_u-boot will fail with a "FDT and ATAGS support not compiled in - hanging" message_
_when trying to boot the loaded image with a single bootm command._
_Yet, we can leave out the OS-specific initialisations by selectively executing
_only the relevant bootm steps as shown above._

You can also enter u-boot's interactive command line and try-out the commands
before. If you are keen, you can even use the tftpboot command to copy the uEnv.txt
without removing the SD card:

! Zynq> tftpboot 0x10000000 x.x.x.x:/srv/tftp/usrp/uEnv.txt
! Filename '/srv/tftp/usrp/uEnv.txt'.
! Load address: 0x10000000
! Loading: #
!         18.6 KiB/s
! done
! Bytes transferred = 154 (9a hex)
! Zynq> fatwrite mmc 0 0x10000000 uEnv.txt ${filesize}


Build and run
=============

With the above preparations, executing a run script on the USRP is as simple
as running:

! make -C build/arm_v7a run/log

As soon as you see 'Terminal ready' hit the power button to reboot the device
and boot the updated image. Alternatively, you can include one of the power_on
scripts in your RUN_OPT to automate the reset as well.
